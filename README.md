# CS231N Final Project
## By Neha Konakalla, Avrum Noor, and Josh Singh

Models, tensors, outputs, labels, and dataset (videos and preprocessed frames) are not included due to memory constraints.

The code above is not cleaned up. It is here in case any question arise about the architectures. Please reach out to one of us with questions.
